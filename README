Compiling
You need SFML 2.1 Headers and Libs to compile the code. 
Put the corresponding sfml-dlls (also Openal32.dll and libsndfile-1.dll) in the build-folder.
If compiling with MinGW you'll need...
libgcc_s_dw2-1.dll
libstdc++-6.dll 
mingwm10.dll 
...too. You can get them from your mingw/bin folder.
